<h3>Chinese Flag History 
The Chinese flag was first hoisted on October 1st 1949 on the occasion of the founding of the PRC, People’s Republic of China. 
<br>
Before then, the previous flag of China was the “Yellow Dragon Flag”. This Chinese flag was used in the Qing Dynasty. The Qing Dynasty is the last imperial dynasty in China’s history. 
<br>
It was on July 4th 1949 that he Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference (新政治協商會議籌備會, PCNPCC) published the notice to submit designs for the national flag, leading to over 3,000 entries in total.
<br>
There was much debate and deliberation over the choice of the current Chinese flag. Mao Zedong preferred a different design. 
<br>
In the end, the committee settled for a slightly edited version of the final design. The flag of China design was selected on 27th September 1949, and published the new official Chinese flag on 29th September, allowing some time for companies and businesses to copy the design. 
<br>
Zhao Wenrui, the seamstress for the flag, finished her sewing around midday on the 30th September. Just in time for it to be hoisted the next day.  
<br>
On October 1st the Chinese flag was hoisted on the flagpole overlooking Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
