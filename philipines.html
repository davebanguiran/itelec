	<h2>Philippines, island country of Southeast Asia in the western Pacific Ocean. It is an archipelago consisting of more than 7,000 islands and islets lying about 500 miles (800 km) off the coast of Vietnam. Manila is the capital, but nearby Quezon City is the country’s most-populous city. Both are part of the National Capital Region (Metro Manila), located on Luzon, the largest island. The second largest island of the Philippines is Mindanao, in the southeast.

Philippines
The Philippines takes its name from Philip II, who was king of Spain during the Spanish colonization of the islands in the 16th century. Because it was under Spanish rule for 333 years and under U.S. tutelage for a further 48 years, the Philippines has many cultural affinities with the West. It is, for example, the second most-populous Asian country (following India) with English as an official language and one of only two predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Asia (the other being East Timor). Despite the prominence of such Anglo-European cultural characteristics, the peoples of the Philippines are Asian in consciousness and aspiration.
<br>
The country was wracked by political turmoil in the last quarter of the 20th century. After enduring more than a decade of authoritarian rule under Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, the broadly popular People Power movement in 1986 led a bloodless uprising against the regime. The confrontation resulted not only in the ouster and exile of Marcos but also in the restoration of democratic government to the Philippines</h2>

<h2>History of the Philippine flag
Our nation's first flag was a red piece of cloth with the letters "K.K.K." arranged in a row in the center of the rectangular field, unfurled during the "First Cry of the Revolution" in August 1896. An earlier version of this flag had three K's arranged in an equilateral triangle, while later versions featured either one or two K's within an eight-rayed sun.

Emilio Aguinaldo and other revolutionary leaders designed the Philippine flag during the second phase of the Philippine Revolution against Spain. It was Marcela Mariño Agoncillo, wife of the first diplomat Felipe Agoncillo, who hand-sewed the new flag, with the help of her daughter Lorenza and Mrs. Delfina Herbosa de Natividad.</h2>
